## Research

Some time ago I got involved in the world of web vulnerabilities and thanks to several hackers from the Hispanic community we met several days to talk about these vulnerabilities. Time went by and I thought, why don't I make a compilation of the most common vulnerabilities in the bug bounty world? So I created the following [repository](https://github.com/h4ns21/CommonWebVulns), I hope you like it!

The only bad thing is that it is in Spanish as it is dedicated to this wonderful community which has helped me a lot on my way.
